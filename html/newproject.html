		<h2 style="color:yellow">CRAFT</h2>
		<p>Craft is an activity such as weaving, carving, or pottery that involves making things skilfully by hand, often in a traditional way. A craft or trade is a pastime or an occupation that requires particular skills and knowledge of skilled work. In a historical sense, particularly the Middle Ages and earlier, the term is usually applied to people occupied in small-scale production of goods, or their maintenance, for example by tinkers..</p>
